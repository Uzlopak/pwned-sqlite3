# Prebuild pwned-Databases

Github has a filesize limitation of 50 MB, so it is not possible to upload the whole database of pwned (15.4 GB). 
Also it would be impractical using a git repository for storing big binary data.
So I created three prebuild databases with the hashes of the 10.000, 100.000 and 1.000.000 most used passwords.
